# ASM Labs
Github Repository to store ASM Lab statements, data and solutions.

Each lab will be stored in a separate folder, which will contain:

* Statment
* Data
* Solution scripts/PDFs

To differentiate between labs for the first and second part of the course, it is suggested to start the lab number by the number of the part, such as *Lab_1-1* or *Lab_2-3*.
